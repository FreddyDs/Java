/*
Write a method set that accepts an index and a value and sets the list's element at that index to have the given value. You may assume that the index is between 0 (inclusive) and the size of the list (exclusive).

Assume that you are adding this method to the LinkedIntList class as defined below:

public class LinkedIntList {
    private ListNode front;   // null for an empty list
    ...
}

*/



//CODE STARTS HERE
public void set(int index, int value){
    int size = 0;
    ListNode current = front;    
    while(size != index){

        current = current.next;
        size ++;

    }
    current.data = value;
}
